# Churn Data Science Project

The Churn data science project focuses on predicting customer churn, which refers to the likelihood of customers discontinuing their service or subscription. Participants use datasets that include features such as customer demographics, usage patterns, transaction history, and service interactions.

## Objectives
- **Predict churn**: Develop a predictive model to estimate the probability of a customer leaving the service.
- **Data analysis**: Analyze customer behavior and identify key factors that influence churn.
- **Feature engineering**: Create and refine features to enhance model performance.
- **Model evaluation**: Assess and optimize the model to achieve high accuracy and actionable insights.

This project helps in understanding customer retention strategies and allows for the application of machine learning techniques in a real-world business context. It emphasizes data preprocessing, feature selection, and performance evaluation.
